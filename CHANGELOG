----------------------------
Version 2.1.0, 10/18/2016
----------------------------

- Updated documentation to reflect new features

- Added user-defined initial time-grids.  Allows for non-uniform
  initial grids, and for bit-wise equivalent time-grids between codes. 	

- New 1D heat equation example, which is an excellent teaching
  tool for learning XBraid. examples/ex-02.c 

- New linear elasticity MFEM driver, drivers/drive-lin-elasticity.cpp

- New scalar ODE example showing how to use the shell-vector option
  with BDF2, ex-01-expanded-bdf2.c

- Renamed and reorganized examples and drivers directories.
  So that all "research and development" files are in drivers,
  and examples will be a stable set of files for instruction and
  introducation to XBraid.

  Also, reworked the examples for consistency in appearance, functionality and
  style.

- Changed make system so that the sequential option is now enabled with
  
  make sequential=yes
  
  similar to the other two options
  
  make debug=yes|no
  make valgrind=yes|no
    
- Added a braid test to test the compatibility of Residual()
  and Step(), i.e., that
  
  f - Residual( Step(u_{i-1}, f_i), u_{i-1}) \approx 0

- Updates and bug fixes to the adaptive refinement in time capabilities

- Unified the status structure implementation 

- Updated Fortran interface to support missing functions


----------------------------
Version 2.0.0, 05/25/2016
----------------------------

- Updated documentation to reflect new features

- Changed the name of "Phi" to "Step", because this is more 
  descriptive of the function's purpose, especially as it
  relates to the new residual function.

- Added major new features
	
  Flexible storage options, allowing for storage at only C
  or at C and F points.  Extra storage gives you better initial
  guesses for implicit solves.  Storage=-2 is compatability mode
  with the original XBraid.  Storage=-1 (storage only at C-points)
  is the default.

  Support for adaptive refinement in time (see FRefine function)
  This was not an easy implementation!

  Support for user-defined residual computations (see User's Manual
  for description).  This can result in computational savings. 

  Support for the new Shell feature which allows for storing meta
  data at all time points (even if storage is turned off at F-points).
  This is useful, for instance, for BDF methods.  See examples.

  Support for skipping work during the first XBraid down-cycle

  Ability to visualize cycling with cycleplot.py (see user_utils) 
  
  Ability to compile without MPI (see makefile.inc and make sequential)

  Ability to compute residual at all points, F and C, as opposed to the
  default with only computes the residual at C-points.

  Added Fortran interface, see ex-01-f.f90. Currently, it is turned on
  manually in braid.h with 3 pound-defines at the top of that file.

- New examples: Burger's equation in 1D and the Lorenz attractors

- Set size_ptr prior to calling bufpack such that: size_ptr = 0 at entry
  to bufpack indicates the message will be used for completing a time
  step on the next processor. At entry size_ptr = 1 indicates the message
  will be used for load balenceing in FRefine.
  
  Reason: Far less information is needed when completing a time step
  than when moving an entire vector to a new processor. In my
  case each vector saves its entire spatial heirachy of meshes.
  To complete a time step on the next processor the message only
  needs to contain the current function and the current mesh. To
  move an entire vector to a new processor the message must contain
  the fine grid solution and mesh + all other coarse grid messages.

- Updates to the MFEM C++ interface and drivers,
  
  drive-05.cpp is a new DG advection diffusion driver, supporting higher-order
  artificial dissipation
  
  drive-06 is a nonlinear diffusion (p-Laplacian) example

  drive-10 is a nonlinear elasticity driver

  1D heat equation with moving mesh driver

- Moved the additional "hypre" functions from drive-04.cpp to hypre_extra.hpp, so
  they can be used in other drivers.
    
- Modification of the access_level. Now, we have:
  - access_level == 0 : do nothing
  - access_level == 1 : call at the end of the simulation (fine grid)
  - access_level == 2 : call at the end of each iteration and end of simulation (fine grid only)
  - access_level == 3 : same as other, plus call in FRestrict, FInterp and FRefine (on all levels).
  

- New regression tests, for among other things, 
  braid_GetSpatialAccuracy
  braid_GetRNorms
  braid_StepStatusGetTol
  braid_StepStatusGetIter
  braid_StepStatusGetRNorms
  braid_StepStatusGetOldFineTolx
  braid_StepStatusSetOldFineTolx
  braid_StepStatusSetTightFineTolx
    
  Note that the Get|Set.*Tolx routines
  are tested implicitly with the tests on
  braid_GetSpatialAccuracy
    
- Changed util.h|c to _util.h|c These files only contain Braid internal
  routines and were as such improperly named.

- Simplified greatly the cycling logic in braid.c::Drive()
    - Allows for interactive printing of cycle information with
      _braid_DriveUpdateCycle() to the cycle.outfile which is
      by default with 'braid.out.cycle'
    - The cycling information in this file can be plotted with
      cycleplot.gnuplot file
    - There is a mpistubs.h|.c for purely serial compilations


- Fixed some bugs in _braid.c and especially in _braid_GetUInit() regarding
   the various storage options, where storage=-2 is compatability mode with
   old braid, and -1 and 0 use more current information.  There is a long comment
   at the top of FRestrict() that outline some of the reasoning behind the issues
   addressed in this commit.

   To test the bug fixes a new option was added braid_SetSeqSoln() which allows
   the user to initialize the problem with the solution from sequential time stepping.
   This is there just for debugging, but can be quite useful.

- Added a number of new features in drive-06 for the nonlinear parabolic
    paper.  These integrate some changes from Ben over the summer, like
    tracking the number of Newton iterations, varying the Newton tolerance
    and capping the number of Newton and BoomerAMG iterations. These options
    are all available from the command line.

- Added new information to status structures

- Switched "isnan()" to our own in-house "braid_isnan()" macro.  This is for
   better portability.  

- Added support for cfactor=1. I believe this one line change is required in
   _braid.c I also added some regression tests to test cfactor=1 on the finest
   grid.


- Cleaned up how the core->rnorms array is accessed with three new accessor
  functions
    _braid_AppendResidual
    _braid_GetRNorm
    _braid_DeleteLasResidual
  The number of residual norms available depends on the skip option and the
  iteration number.  Sometimes there are resdiual norms available, sometimes not.
  And the number available does not equal the number of iterations.  So, these
  functions make all that easier.

- Fixed a memory problem with the rnorms array when MaxIter is changed by the user.

- Added NaN check for braid residuals to stop iterating. 

- Updated drive-02 so that it uses the storage and new residual options.

- A tolerance <= 0.0 now means that iterations will proceed until max_iter is
  reached.
 
- Updated accuracy handle 
   

----------------------------
Version 1.1.b, 03/10/2015
----------------------------

- Updated documentation to reflect new features

- Split examples directory into "examples" and "drivers"
  examples holds simple user-friendly examples.  Currently that's
  ex-01 and ex-02, a scalar ODE and heat equation example, respectively.
    
  ex-02 is a simplified example that only does backward Euler and corresponds
  to ex-02-serial which is a mock-up of a simple user application that we
  parallelize in time with ex-02.
    
  drivers holds more sophisticated drivers that we use for research
  This is where all the old drivers (drive-02, drive-03, drive-04,
  drive-05 and hyperdrive) ended up.
    
  The old drive-02 was eliminated, and replaced by the old drive-05.
  These drivers duplicated functionality.
    
  Associated regression tests were added for the new examples

- New information available through the Status structures in Phi, 
	like the current XBraid level.

- Drive-05 now supports spatial parallelism and spatial coarsening on
  regular grids.

	Also, changed the drive-05 interface to more easily allow playing around
	with varying coarse grid CFL numbers.  Also added a couple comments to
	_braid.c that better explain the grid structure's data elements.


----------------------------
Version 1.0.b, 10/27/2014
----------------------------

- Implements basic MGRIT algorithm, see newly written 
  User's and Developer's Manuals for overview

- Decided on Git repository for collaboration and development of XBraid 

- Developed logo 

- Decided on name "XBraid" after too many conflicts with "Warp", 
  our first choice

- Developed C++ interface, see braid.hpp which implements abstract
  base classes for wrapping Phi(), Clone(), ..., and then see 
  drivers/drive-04.cpp which uses the interface

- Basic driver and example functionality for the heat equation 
  (drive-04.cpp, drive-03.c, ...)

- Added wrapper test functions to test things like Sum(), Access(), ...

- Developed suite of regression tests (see test directory)

- Added Copyright and License statements for LGPL 2.1 

- Allow for 1-norm and inf-norm halting options

- Implemented Status structure interface which allows for us to 

- Added some debug level printing to allow for tracking the residual
  value over each interval, see braid_SetPrintLevel  
	 
- Added ability to do enhanced F-cycles (i.e. mutliple V-cycles at each level
	in an FMG cycle)

- Made design decisions for the user to include PDE forcing inside of Phi().
  XBraid implements FAS, so this should be fine.
